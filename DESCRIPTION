Description: This package implements the Fundamental Algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem. The user interacts with
the package using R, and the algorithm is programmed in c++. Users can enter a pair of preference tables, the names contained
in which can be a mixture of string and integer data types. The output is a matrix containing a stable matching as produced
by the Fundamental Algorithm.
